# Not Scrabble
> An engine for a game that on the outside resembles the game Scrabble. It's not though. I promise. Please stop saying it is. Seriously. It's not.

## Usage

1. Depend on it

    Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

    ```yaml
    dependencies:
        not_scrabble:
            git:
                url: git://github.com/SuspiciouslyCool/NotScrabble.git
                ref: master
    ```
2. Install it

    You can install packages from the command line:

    with Flutter:
    ```
    $ flutter pub get
    ```
    Alternatively, your editor might support flutter pub get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.
3. Import it

    Now in your Dart code, you can use:

    ```dart
    import 'package:not_scrabble/not_scrabble.dart';
    ```
